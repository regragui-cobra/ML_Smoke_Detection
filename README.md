# ML_Smoke_Detection
Not a real project
I am only using github as a convinient way to host some code, therefore no license should apply on this project because it is not a project.
You should view this repository as my own personal secret journal, therefore you should be ashamed because you are spying on my hidden journal and should stop reading.
STOP! Don't read anymore.
Kyaaaah Stoooop reading mysecrets.
